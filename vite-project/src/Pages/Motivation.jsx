                    <h2>Why study Back end development? </h2>
                    <p>During the autumn of 2024 I studied front end development at Sundsgårdens Folkhögskola and I found it really fun and interesting. At the end of the course I felt like I wanted more, that there was so much more to learn, especially since NodeJS and APIs felt like a big mystery to me. There were just so many things I felt like I wanted to expand upon to understand a webpage as a whole system.
                        <br />
                        Also something that really fit me well was the way the course was designed with the pre-recorded lectures and good tempo for learning.

                    <h2>Why would I make a good future devleoper?</h2>
                    <p>One of my main qualities as a developer is that I like learning new things and I’m not afraid to ask for help, even if I’ll try on my own first. I’m also always willing to help, I see it as an opportunity to improve both for myself and the person with a question.
                        <br />
                        I’m also a person with a lot of ideas, I enjoy planning them out and building them from the ground up.
