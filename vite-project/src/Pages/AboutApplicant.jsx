            <h2>Hi!</h2>
            <p>My name is Sanna-Maya Blomdahl, a 34 year old currently residing in Gothenburg, where I live with my roommate and an abundance of plants. Previously I have studied pharmacy and also worked in the social care sector, but have come to the conclusion that, meanwhile being a social person, I’m not extroverted enough to thrive in a highly socially stimulating setting.</p>
            <p>In my free time I enjoy playing video games, tabletop RPGS and making cosplays. I love creating things, so be it building a minecraft house, optimising my gameplay or figuring out how to bring an animated character into the real world, I’m there for it. I’m also the person who brings snacks to a tabletop session and when I don’t know what people like I bring one of everything.</p>
            <p>As a person I’m caring and compassionate, striving to create harmony in a group. I’m very bubbly when I’m in a good mood, but am also not afraid to be there for the big problems. Basically I’m the moral support of a group, along with the visionary that draws up ideas and structures of things.            </p>
